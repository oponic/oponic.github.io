  <h1>Portfolio or something</h1>
  <h3>My name is Opo (or not, my name is not Opo irl)</h3>
  <p>If you think I'm bad in web design, I just don't believe in flashy portfolio sites. Plain HTML gets the job done, and looks better than that bullshit.<p>
    <h3>I'm interested in</h3>
    <p>- Programming<br>
    - Graphic Design<br>
    - Music<br>
      - Writing<br>
    - Computers (let's pretend I didn't say this already)</p>
  <h3>When will you get to the good part I don't care</h3>
  <p>Alright, alright<br>
  My discord is 'opo9440'. <br>My Substack is https://opopo.substack.com. <br>My Bluesky is @opopo.substack.com. <br>Is that what you wanted???</p>
